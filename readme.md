### Introduction ###
This is a book research application, and I used the Google Book API to show the result and control the user with the Json Web Token(TWT) for authorization. Currently, I set in 30sec for the expiration of the token, but available to change the time. It is a solo project that I build in full stack, and in the future, I will make user bookshelves to store the books they liked or save.
